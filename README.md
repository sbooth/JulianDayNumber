# JulianDayNumber

Julian day number (JDN) and Julian date (JD) calculations supporting proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendars.

Conversion to and from dates in the range `-9999-01-01` to `99999-12-31` is supported.

The JDN conversion algorithms are adapted from Richards, E.G. 2012, "[Calendars](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/downloads/c15_usb_online.pdf)," from the *Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 3rd edition*, S.E Urban and P.K. Seidelmann eds., (Mill Valley, CA: University Science Books), Chapter 15, pp. 585-624.
